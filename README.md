## How to Compile and Run

To compile and run any of the C++ files in this repository, you will need a C++ compiler (like g++).

1.  **Compile**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you have cloned this repository. Then, compile a `.cpp` file using g++:

    ```bash
    g++ -o <output_filename> <source_file.cpp>
    # Example: g++ -o 01 01.cpp
    ```

2.  **Run**: After successful compilation, you can run the executable:

    ```bash
    ./<output_filename>
    # Example: ./01
    ```
